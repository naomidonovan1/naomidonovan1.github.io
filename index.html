<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in the Neuroscience Program at UCSF, currently in my second year!
    I'm a part of the Abbasi Lab and work on projects combining state-of-the-art deep-learning models with
    large-scale neural recordings to understand how the brain encodes information.
